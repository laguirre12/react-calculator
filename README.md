# React-Calculator

## TODO's:
1. create a calculator object that stores the state of the calculator app
2. CSS styling and layout
3. CSS for buttons
4. jsdoc?
5. add mulitple colorings/styles for the calculator (in options)
6. rather than creating long chains of expressions, instead only allow
   for short 2-value computations. This should eliminate (1)
8. create an Operations type? Or, some standardized way of defining what
   operations do and how they'll affect the state
9. Keyboard shortcuts??
11. Output components multiple lines to show equation
